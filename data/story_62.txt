And for the third time the voice of the accuser
recounted the evil deeds of the man, but
of the good he named none.
And the voice from behind the door gave in
answer: “Get thee hence! The kingdom of
heaven not by a sinner can be entered.”
And replied the sinner: “Thy voice I hear,
but thy face I see not, and thy name I know
not.”
Answered the voice: “I am John, the beloved
disciple of Christ.”
And rejoiced the sinner, and spake:  “Now
verily shall I be let in. Peter and David shall
admit me because they know the weakness of
man, and the grace of God; but thou shalt admit
me because thou hast much love. For hast
thou not writ in thy book, O John, that God is
Love, and that whosoever knoweth not Love,
knoweth not God? Wert not thou he that
spake in his old age unto men only this one
word: ‘Brethren, love ye one another’? How
then shalt thou now hate me and drive me
hence? Either renounce thine own words, or
learn to love me, and admit me into the kingdom
of heaven.”
