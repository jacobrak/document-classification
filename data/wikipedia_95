Hans-Werner Gessmann (24 March 1950 – 3 October 2023) was a German psychologist and university teacher who founded humanistic psychodrama and taught in Russia, India, and Africa.


== Career ==
Gessmann received a doctorate in 1976 for his work on the causative factors of dyslexia. He is credited as the founder of humanistic psychodrama and was among the first to apply psychodrama with hypnosis in the context of sexual dysfunctions. In the last two decades of his career, he focused on the diagnosis and therapy of transgender people and was recognized as a court expert in Germany. He also established humanistic psychodrama in the field of child psychotherapy. In the early 1980s, he began producing film documentaries documenting full group psychotherapy sessions across European countries.. He published a book series and the International Journal of Humanistic Psychodrama. Gessmann conducted empirical research in psychodrama and published over 200 articles on psychological topics.Starting in 1996, he continued his research on the method of doubling. He was the only author in the German-speaking world to address this topic, and he included translations of source texts from English.
In 1973, he founded the Psychotherapeutic Institute Bergerhausen (PIB) in Duisburg. In 1977, he founded a European training center in nearby Kerpen, Germany, which now serves more than 1500 psychotherapists.
In 1986, Gessmann founded what is claimed to be Germany's first home-based sleep laboratory with the Department of Sleep Medicine. Under his guidance, tongue muscle training, with the registered trademark ZMT ®, was developed as an alternative treatment for sleep apnea from 1998 to 2002.
Gessmann developed and taught humanistic psychodrama from 1979 onwards, which became a key component of humanistic psychology. He emphasized the importance of collective action and the nature of people in therapeutic ethics. He considered faith, love, hope, and the idea of human community as essential to meaningful humanistic psychodrama. The goals and methods of classical psychodrama were re-evaluated and described. This is said to have led to a change in international psychodrama practice.
Gessmann was a member of the American Society of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama as well as the International Association of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama since 1977.
Gessmann taught clinical psychology in the faculty of social psychology of the State University Kostroma in Kostroma (KSU) from 2007 and was a professor of general and developmental psychology at the governmental Academy of Social Administration Moscow (ASOU).
After the introduction of the test for medical study courses in 1986, Gessmann reconstructed it several times for training purposes. These training versions were published under the title Ü-TMS.
In April 2011, he was announced as the director of the International Centre for Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy (ICCPP) at the governmental University Kostroma, focusing on psychotherapy training and research, particularly humanistic psychodrama and systemic family therapy. In March 2020, he transitioned from Kostroma to the State Medical Medicine University in Krasnoyarsk, working with the International Center of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy. The ICCPP grew, operating in over 30 countries with over 200 specialists. He was the chief editor of the scientific ICCPP-Journal.
From February 2012, he was a professor of systemic family therapy and humanistic psychodrama at the Moscow State University of Psychology and Education (МГППУ)]. From the beginning of 2013, Gessmann was a visiting professor at the State University Smolensk, where he taught Humanistic Psychodrama. In the same year, Gessmann purportedly received a call from the Chair for Humanistic Psychodrama at the Southeast University in Nanjing province Jiangsu in China. He was allegedly added to lists of influential psychologists and counseling psychologists by Stanford University U.C. in Berkeley and Harvard University, respectively. In September 2017, Hans-Werner Gessmann introduced group psychotherapy in Azerbaijan, with 141 psychotherapists from the country participating in Baku. He was a member of the International Organizing Committee of the VI International Scientific and Practical Conference at the State Krasnoyarsk Medical University Prof. V.F. Volno-Yasenetzky in 2019. He worked as a visiting professor for Clinical psychology and psychotherapy at the State Krasnoyarsk Medical University Prof. V.F. Volno-Yasenetzky from March 2020. From May 2021 to December 2022, he was an adjunctive professor at the Madras Social Work Academy in Chennai for humanistic psychology. In June 2021, he was appointed as head of the Department of Psychology at DMI - St. John the Baptist University in Malawi. From 2021 through 2023, he was an International Member of the American Psychological Association (APA). Gessmann delivered lectures on humanistic psychodrama as group psychotherapy and offered presentations on psychosomatics with his scientific assistant Vishal Lohchab during August and September 2023 at the CHRIST (Deemed to be University) in New Delhi and Bangalore.  Gessmann and Vishal Lohchab co-authored two psychological books and worked together for four years.
