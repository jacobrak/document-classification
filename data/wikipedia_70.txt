== History ==
The international Miss Universe pageants started in 1952. Until 2000, while the Miss Australia Awards were held, the winners of the Miss Australia pageant would normally represent Australia at international Miss Universe pageants, but Australia did not have a representative in each year's event.
In 1952 Leah MacCartney was the first Miss Universe Australia. She was Miss Victoria and later elected as Miss Universe Australia 1952 on 16 June 1952 in Melbourne.
In 1958 the independent pageant selected Miss Universe Australia. Miss Universe Australia partnered to Australian Photographic Agency (APA).
In 1964 and 1965 Miss Universe Australia selected by Agency casting in Melbourne.
Between 1968 and 1976 the winners of Quest of Quests Dream Girl Australia represented Australia at Miss Universe.
Between 1977 and 1990 the winners of Miss Australia Beauty or Miss Universe Australia by TVW Enterprises represented Australia at Miss Universe.
There was no Australian entrant to the Miss Universe pageant in 1991 and 2001.  In 2002 through 2004, the Australian representative to the Miss Universe pageant was chosen by a national pageant held in Sydney, organised by Adpro Management Group.
The national Miss Universe Australia pageant came under new management in 2005. Of the 307 who participated at the state level, 24 made it to the national pageant, and Michelle Guy became Miss Universe Australia 2005.
