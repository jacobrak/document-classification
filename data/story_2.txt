MIRIAM
The translations given in this volume,
with the exception of the
storm-scene from Tolstoy in the First
Lecture, are my own.
The reader will please bear in mind
that these Lectures, printed here exactly
as delivered, were written with a view to
addressing the ear as well as the eye,
otherwise the book would have been
entirely different from what it now is.
