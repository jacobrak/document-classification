The Stolpersteine in the Kraj Vysočina lists the Stolpersteine in the Vysočina Region  (IPA: [ˈvɪsotʃɪna]; Czech: Kraj Vysočina "Highlands Region") in the south-east of Bohemia. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist Gunter Demnig. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.
Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: Kameny zmizelých, stones of the disappeared.
The lists are sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.
