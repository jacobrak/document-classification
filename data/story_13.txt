“He now was no longer, but the hands of
Solomin and Marianne were still joined across
his breast.”
20. From this pure melancholy and measured
sadness, go to Dickens and read his account
of the death of little Nell, or to George
Eliot and read her account of Maggie Tulliver's
death. I venture to think you will need
no comment of mine to perceive the difference;
and the difference, I regret to say, is
not in favor of the English masters.
21. But not only in the field of pathos is
this moderation of the Russian striking; in
the field of description of nature, of which
both the English and the Russian are so fond
in their literature, the two literatures offer
abundant material for comparison, and I will
permit myself to quote to you a passage from
Dickens for the purpose of illustrating how the
Russians go to work with a similar subject:
“It was small tyranny for a respectable wind
to go wreaking its vengeance on such poor creatures
as the fallen leaves; but this wind happening
to come up with a great heap of them
just after venting its humor on the insulted
Dragon, did so disperse and scatter them that
they fled away, pell-mell, some here, some
there, rolling over each other, whirling round
and round upon their thin edges, taking frantic
flights into the air, and playing all manner of
gambols in the extremity of their distresses.
Nor was this enough for its malicious fury, for
not content with driving them abroad, it charged
small parties of them and hunted them into the
wheelwright's saw-pit and below the planks
and timbers in the yard, and scattering the
sawdust in the air, it looked for them underneath,
and when it did meet with any, whew!
how it drove them on and followed at their
heels!
“The scared leaves only flew the faster for
all this, and a giddy chase it was; for they got
into unfrequented places, where there was no
outlet, and where their pursuer kept them eddying
round at his pleasure, and they crept under
the eaves of the houses, and clung tightly to the
sides of hay-ricks, like bats, and tore in at open
chamber windows, and cowered close to hedges,
and, in short, went everywhere for safety.”—Martin
Chuzzlewit, ii.
