The "Chirping" Crickets is the only studio album from the American rock and roll band the Crickets, led by Buddy Holly.  It was the group's only album released during Holly's lifetime. In 2012, it was ranked number 420 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It also appears in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.
The LP was released in the US in 1957, and in the UK in 1958. It was re-released by Coral in 1962 as Buddy Holly and the Crickets. After being out of print for many years, it was reissued as a remastered CD in 2004 with bonus tracks.
In July 2019, the album was the subject for the BBC Four documentary Classic Albums: The Crickets: The 'Chirping' Crickets.
In July 2023, the album was reissued by Rollercoaster Records in England as  The Alternative "Chirping" Crickets, a CD containing remixed Mono, Stereo plus the twelve tracks, in stereo but without the backing vocals that the Crickets felt were intrusive and inappropriate. Positive reviews followed.
