“This also I know, and yet I am ready to
enter.”
“Enter, then.”
The girl stepped over the threshold, and the
heavy curtain dropped behind her. “Fool!”
some one muttered behind her. “Saint!” came
from somewhere in reply.
15. These, then, were the two leading traits
of this man Turgenef. He had the fighting
temperament of the warrior in his heart, and
the doubting temperament of the philosopher
in his head: to the first he owed the choice
of his road; to the second, the manner of
traversing it. His six great works of art are
 all tragedies. Rudin dies a needless death
on a barricade; Insarof dies before he
even reaches the land he is to liberate;
Bazarof dies from accidental blood-poisoning
and Nezhdanof dies by his own hand.
Here again critics are at hand with an explanation
which does not explain. Turgenef,
the artist, the poet, the creator, does
not know, they say, how to dispose of his
heroes at the end of his stories, and he therefore
kills them off. The truth, however, is that
the sceptic, pessimistic Turgenef could not
as an artist faithful to his belief do aught
else with his heroes than to let them perish.
For to him cruel fate, merciless destiny, was
not mere figure of speech, but reality of
realities. To Turgenef, life was at bottom a
tragedy; and whatever the auspices under
which he sent forth his heroes, he felt that
sooner or later they must become victims of
blind fate, brute force, of the relentlessly
grinding, crushing mill of the gods.
16. I have thus attempted to give you an
interpretation of Turgenef which perhaps explains
not only his life but also the peculiar
 direction of his works; not only the vices of
his intellect, but also the virtues of his art.
