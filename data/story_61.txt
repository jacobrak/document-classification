Said the sinner: “Lord, thy voice I hear,
but thy face I see not, and thy name I know
not.”
And the voice said unto him: “I am David,
the king and the prophet.” But the sinner
despaired not, nor went he away from the
gates of heaven, but spake as follows: “Have
mercy upon me, King David, and think of the
weakness of man and the mercy of God. God
loved thee and raised thee up before men. Thine
 was all,—a kingdom, and glory, and riches, and
wives, and children; yet when thou didst espy
from thy roof the wife of a poor man, sin betook
thee, and thou hast taken the wife of Uriah, and
himself hast thou slain by the sword of the
Ammonites. Thou, a rich man, hast taken his
last lamb from the poor man, and hast slain the
owner himself. The same of me!
“And think further how thou hast repented,
and said: ‘I confess my guilt, and repent of my
sin.’ The same of me. Not for thee 'tis to refuse
me entrance.”
And the voice behind the door was hushed.
And after standing some time, again knocked
the sinner, and asked admission into the kingdom
of heaven. And from behind the doors
was heard a third voice which spake: “Who is
this, and how hath he lived on earth?”
