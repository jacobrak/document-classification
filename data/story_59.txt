Said the sinner: “Lord, I hear thy voice,
but I see not thy countenance and know not
thy name.”
And the voice gave in reply: “I am Peter
the Apostle.”
Said the sinner: “Have mercy upon me,
Apostle Peter; remember the weakness of man,
and the mercy of God. Was it not you who was
a disciple of Christ, and was it not you who
heard from his own lips his teaching, and saw
the example of his life? And now remember,
when he was weary and sad in spirit, and thrice
asked thee not to slumber, but to pray, you
slept, because your eyes were heavy, and thrice
he found you sleeping. The same of me.
“And remember likewise how thou hast
promised to him not to renounce him until thy
dying day, and yet thou didst renounce him
 thrice when they led him away. The same of
me.
“And remember likewise how crowed the
cock, and thou hast gone forth and wept bitterly.
The same of me. Not for thee 'tis to
refuse me entrance.”
