THE THRESHOLD.
I see a huge building; in its front wall
a narrow door opens wide; behind the door
gloomy darkness. At the high threshold stands
a girl, a Russian girl.
Frost waves from that impenetrable darkness,
and with the icy breeze comes forth from the
depth of the building a slow, hollow voice.
“O thou, eager to step across this threshold,
knowest thou what awaits thee?”
“I know,” answers the girl.
