And the voice from behind the gates of
heaven was hushed.
And after standing some time, again knocked
the sinner, and asked admittance into the kingdom
of heaven.
And from behind the doors there was heard
another voice which spake: “Who is this, and
how has he lived on earth?”
And the voice of the accuser gave answer,
and repeated all the evil deeds of the sinner;
and of the good deeds he named none.
And the voice from behind the door called:
“Get thee hence. Sinners such as thou cannot
live with us in Paradise.”
