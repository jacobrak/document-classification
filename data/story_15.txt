“Tpru! the trace is broken, and in spite of
the unceasing, deafening claps of thunder, we
are forced to halt upon the bridge.
“I lean my head against the side of the
britchka, and, catching my breath with a sinking
of the heart, I listen despairingly to the
 movements of Philip's fat black fingers, as he
slowly ties a knot, and straightens out the
traces, and strikes the side horse with palm
and whip-handle.
“The uneasy feelings of sadness and terror
increase within me with the force of the storm;
but when the grand moment of silence arrives,
which generally precedes the thunder-clap, these
feelings had reached such a point, that, if this
state of things had lasted a quarter of an hour,
I am convinced that I should have died of excitement.
At the same moment, there appears
from beneath the bridge a human form, clothed
in a dirty, ragged shirt, with a bloated senseless
face, a shaven, wagging, totally uncovered head,
crooked, nerveless legs, and a shining red stump
in place of a hand, which he thrusts out directly
at the britchka.
“‘Ba-a-schka![1] Help-a-cripple-for-Christ's-sake!’
says the beggar, beginning to repeat his
petition by rote, in a weak voice, as he crosses
himself at every word, and bows to his very
belt.
“I cannot describe the feeling of chill terror
which took possession of my soul at that moment.
A shudder ran through my hair, and my
eyes were riveted on the beggar, in a stupor of
fright.
