== Name meaning ==
Lead vocalist Jon Lewis explains:

The album coming out in May is called Weights & Measures and it's just talking about [how] as a society, we're always looking at peer pressure, seeing if we measure up to everybody else. We're always comparing ourselves and weighing ourselves against everybody. So, this album is really just talking about that struggle and that fight.
