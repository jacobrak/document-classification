18. But the great danger of intensity is
extravagance; and Napoleon, who knew men
well, could with justice say that the roots of
Genius and Insanity are in the same tree, and
indeed few are the writers of genius who have
successfully coped with extravagance. It is
the peculiar fortune however of the Russian
writers to be comparatively free from it; and
their second great virtue is the one which
formed the cardinal virtue of a nation from
whom we have still much to learn, the Temperance
of the Greeks.
19. And of the virtues of which Temperance,
Measuredness, is the parent, there are
two, of which the first is Moderation and the
second is Modesty: moderation with reference
to things outside of the soul; modesty with
reference to things inside of the soul. And
for the highest example of moderation, you
must read Turgenef's account of Nezhdanof's
suicide in “Virgin Soil,” or his account of
 the drowning of Marya Pavlovna in “Back
Woods;” the first of which I will take the
liberty to read to you.
“Nezhdanof sprang up from the sofa; he went
twice round the room, then stopped short for a
minute lost in thought; suddenly he shook himself,
took off his ‘masquerading’ dress, kicked
it into the corner, fetched and put on his former
clothes.
“Then he went up to the three-legged small
table and took from the drawer two sealed envelopes,
and a small object which he put into his
pocket, but the envelopes he left on the table.
“He then leaned down and opened the door
of the stove.… The stove contained a heap
of ashes. This was all that was left of Nezhdanof's
papers and private book of verses.…
He had burned them all during the night.
But in this same stove, leaning against one of
the walls, was Marianne's portrait, Markelof's
gift. Evidently Nezhdanof had not had the
courage to burn this portrait with the rest; he
took it out carefully and put it on the table by
the side of the sealed papers.
