The Democratic National Movement (Greek: Δημοκρατικό Εθνικό Κίνημα , romanized: Dimokratiko Ethniko Kinima) is an ultra-conservative political party in Cyprus led by Andreas Themistokleous. Established in January 2025, the party was created by Themistokleous following his expulsion from the far-right National Popular Front (ELAM) due to "inappropriate behavior."
