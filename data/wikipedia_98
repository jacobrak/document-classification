Still Life is the second solo album by Renaissance vocalist Annie Haslam, recorded with Louis Clark and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in 1985. The album consisted of popular classical tunes set to the lyrics of poet and Renaissance lyricist Betty Thatcher. A remastered two-disc edition was released on April 25, 2011, with the second disc offering an instrumental version of each song.


== Reception ==

The Bolton News described Still Life as the marriage of classical and popular music at its very best. Allmusic's Tomas Mureika retrospectively called it "one of Haslam's career highlights: a gorgeous, lyrical, and endlessly listenable collection of classical pop nuggets, topped off with brilliant—often profound—lyrics."
