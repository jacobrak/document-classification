== Critical reception ==
The Times of India wrote, "The film's narrative is quite fractured. Rather than moving from one incident to the other, here, it moves from one issue to the other at a rapid pace giving us a false sense of momentum." The Hindu called it "more a visual representation of a protagonist in a television programme [..] than a film".


== Home media ==
The film is available on online streaming platform Netflix.
