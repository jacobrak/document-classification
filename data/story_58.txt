There lived in the world a man for seventy
years, and all his life he lived in sin. And this
man fell ill, and still he did not repent. But
when death was nigh, at the last hour, he began
to weep, and said, “Lord, as thou hast forgiven
the thief on the cross, so do thou forgive me!”
He had scarcely spoken, and away flew his
soul. And the sinner's soul began to love God,
and, trusting his mercy, came to the gates of
heaven.
And the sinner began to knock, and to ask
admission into the kingdom of heaven.
And from behind the door he heard a voice:
“Who is this knocking for admission into the
gates of heaven, and what are the deeds this
man in his lifetime has done?”
And the voice of the accuser gave answer,
and recounted all the sinful deeds of this man;
and of good deeds he named none.
And the voice from behind the door answered:
“Sinners cannot enter the kingdom of
heaven. Get thee hence!”
