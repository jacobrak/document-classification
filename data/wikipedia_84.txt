The NRS-2 (Нож Разведчика Стреляющий, "Scout Firing Knife") (official GRAU index 6P25U) is a gun hybrid with a combination of a knife blade and a built-in single-shot shooting mechanism designed to fire a 7.62×41mm SP-4 (СП-4) cartridge, originally designed for the PSS silent pistol.
It was manufactured by the Tula Arms Plant for Soviet Spetsnaz troops in the 1980s, and is still used as a personal weapon for modern Spetsnaz troops and special law enforcement groups. The NRS-2 is designed for either stabbing or throwing with the blade, or fired at distances of up to 25 metres.


== Shooting mechanism ==
To load the shooting mechanism, the opening lever is pressed, and the barrel rotated out of the knife handle. Then the cartridge is inserted into the firing chamber and the barrel is reinserted back into the handle and rotated into place using two prongs that fit into the outer latch. The flip-up lever on the right side of the NRS-2 is then pulled to cock the internal hammer. Before firing the safety catch, located beside the barrel, must be turned to the "fire" position. The user's left hand is then used to hold the underside of the grip, the right hand held against the right side with the right index finger placed on the single action push-button trigger, which is located above the safety catch beside the gun barrel.


== NR-2 survival knife ==
A modified version of the NRS-2, the NR-2, with the shooting mechanism replaced by a container of survival equipment, was also developed.
