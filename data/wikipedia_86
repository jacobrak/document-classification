Mount Austin Barracks was a British Army base in Hong Kong during British rule. It was acquired in 1897 and developed from the former Mount Austin Hotel. It is named after John Gardiner Austin, former Hong Kong Colonial Secretary. It was located near the Peak Tram terminus at Victoria Peak.
The base consisted of a series of multi-storey buildings on a hill. Damaged during World War II, it was later demolished.
Units that were stationed at the base:
