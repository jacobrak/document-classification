It now serves as the Somerville Borough Hall and the Somerville Public Library. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 5, 2008 for its significance in architecture from 1888 to 1939.


== History ==
The Daniel Robert House is the third building at this location. The first was a tavern built early in the 19th century and the second was built by Albert Cammann in 1848. Daniel Robert, a wealthy businessman from New York, bought the property in 1886. He tore down the Cammann house in 1887 and built the current mansion. He lived here until his death in 1908. His widow sold it to the Somerville Lodge of the Elks in 1923. The borough bought it in 1958 for use as the Borough Hall.
