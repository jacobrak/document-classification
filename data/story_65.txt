“‘'Tis all ended,’ she said. ‘I have nothing
left but thee. Remember this.’
“‘I cannot help remembering what constitutes
my life. For one minute of this blessedness …’
“‘Blessedness!’ she uttered with terror and
disgust, and her terror communicated itself to
him. ‘For God's sake, not a word, not one
word more!’
“She quickly rose and turned away from him.
“‘Not another word,’ she repeated; and with
 an expression strange to him, with an expression
of cold despair on her face, she parted
from him. She felt that at this moment she
could not express in words her feeling of shame,
joy, and terror before this entrance into a new
life, and she did not wish to speak of it, to lower
that feeling with inexact words. But even later,
on the morrow, and on the third day, she not
only could find no words for expressing the
whole complexity of these feelings, but she
could not find even thoughts, in revolving which
she might clearly define to herself whatever was
going on in her soul.
