“In a few moments Marianne, Solomin, Paul,
and two factory workmen were already in the
enclosure; Nezhdanof was at once raised, carried
into his chamber, and placed on a sofa
where he had spent his last night.
“He lay on his back, his half-closed eyes remained
fixed, his face was lead-colored; he
breathed slowly and laboriously, catching each
breath as if choking. Life had not yet left
him.
“Marianne and Solomin stood on each side
of the couch, almost as pale as Nezhdanof himself.
Both were stunned, startled, crushed, especially
Marianne, but they were not surprised.
‘Why did not we foresee this?’ each thought;
and yet at the same time it seemed to them that
they … yes, they had foreseen it. When he
said to Marianne, ‘Whatever I do, I warn you
of it beforehand, you will not be surprised,’ and
again, when he had spoken of the two men that
existed in him, who can yet not live together,
did not something like a presentiment stir in
her? Why then did she not stop at that moment
and reflect upon these words and this presentiment?
Why does not she dare now to look
at Solomin, as if he were her accomplice …
as if he too were suffering remorse? Why was
the feeling of infinite pity, of desperate regret
with which Nezhdanof inspired her mingled
with a kind of terror, with shame, with remorse?
Might she perhaps have saved him?
Why does neither of them dare to utter a word?
They hardly dare to breathe; they wait; what
are they waiting for, Great God?
“Solomin sent for a surgeon, although there
was of course no hope; upon the small black
bloodless wound Tatyana had put a sponge with
cold water, and moistened his hair also with
cold water and vinegar; suddenly Nezhdanof
ceased choking and made a slight movement.
“‘He is coming to himself,’ muttered Solomin.
