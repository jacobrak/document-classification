“Helen covered her face. ‘You wished to
compel me to say that I love you,’ she whispered—‘there,
I have said it.’
“‘Helen!’ exclaimed Insarof.
“She took his hands, looked at him, and fell
upon his breast.
“He embraced her firmly, and remained silent.
There was no need of telling her that he loved
her. From his one exclamation, from this instantaneous
transformation of the whole man,
from the manner in which rose and fell that
breast to which she clung so trustfully, from the
 manner in which the tips of his fingers touched
her hair, Helen could see that she was loved.
He was silent, but she needed no words. ‘He
is here, he loves; what more is there needed?’
The calm of blessedness, the quiet of the undisturbed
haven, of the attained goal, that heavenly
calm which lends a meaning and a beauty to
death itself, filled her whole being with a godly
wave. She wished nothing, because she possessed
everything. ‘O my brother, my friend,
my darling!’ her lips whispered; and she herself
knew not whose heart it was, his or hers, which
was so sweetly beating and melting away in her
breast.
“But he stood motionless, enclosing in his
firm embrace the young life which had just
given itself entire unto him; he felt on his
breast this new, priceless burden; a feeling of
tenderness, a feeling of gratitude inexpressible,
shivered into dust his hard soul, and tears,
hitherto unknown to him, came to his eyes.
