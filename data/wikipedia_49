Nicholas Peacock was a farmer from County Limerick in Ireland, who kept a diary from the years 1740 to 1751. It was a detailed account of his daily life and work, living in the townlands of Kilcorly and Kilmoreen, Adare.
When it was published in 2006, the diary was described by its editor as "a valuable record of the day to day life of a man living at a level of Irish society of which we know little or nothing. This diary is one of the most complex and detailed accounts existing of life in rural Ireland in the mid-eighteenth century".
