Mitchell's National Democratic Congress won the 2022 general election with slightly over 51% of the popular vote and winning nine out of the fifteen available seats. 
Mitchell reacted to the election victory by announcing that he would ask the governor-general, Dame CÃ©cile La Grenade, to declare 24 June a national public or bank holiday so that "citizens can celebrate the liberation day and the victory that they have created for Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique". 
On 24 June, Mitchell was sworn in as the ninth prime minister of Grenada, succeeding Keith Mitchell (no relation). He pledged to end nepotism in the Grenadian society and reform the electoral system.  He took the additional portfolio of Minister of Finance of Grenada and created a new Ministry called the Ministry of Mobilization, Implementation and Transformation. During his speech at the swearing-in of Ministers ceremony, he promised to pay teachers their withheld salaries.
A supporter of Grenada becoming a republic, Mitchell said he hopes to see his country become one during his administration.
