“Cold, hunger, hatred, ridicule, scorn, insolence,
prison, illness, death itself!”
“I know it.”
“Complete isolation, loneliness.”
“I know it.… But I am ready. I shall
endure all the sorrows, all the blows.”
“Not only at the hands of your enemies, but
also at the hands of your family and friends.”
